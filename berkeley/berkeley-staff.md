Rev. Natalie Villeda (sounds like: ve le da), Bishop of BPI Berkeley

[Natalie Image]

Natalie was born on the north side of Chicago, Illinois during one of Chicago’s worst snow blizzards in history. The snow was stacked 6ft high in the streets. The blanket of snow brought the windy city to a quiet stand still as Natalie was birthed into the world.

Natalie grew up seeing and hearing things all the time, she was lucky to have been born into a family that would let her talk about it, even though they did not always understand her. As a child Natalie was very aware of energy and always took a long time observing people before she got close, it was important to check out the energy of a person before she jumped into being friends. Once when she was 3 years old she was walking down the street with her mother. Her mother stopped in front of a church and said “Hey let’s go in here and talk to God for a bit” Natalie proceeded to cut loose and run down the street in the other direction. She has since learned there is no use being in resistance, communication with God is fun and she now runs towards the big guy in the sky.

In the 7th grade Natalie had a science teacher that told her that everything was made of the same stuff, atoms, and that these little pieces of energy were simply vibrating at different speeds. This made sense to Natalie and she started thinking about her school desk, her skin and her lunch all made of the same stuff. She resolved that someday she was going to learn how to manipulate these vibrations.

Natalie holds a degree in Women's Studies from UC Santa Cruz and has worked in many different areas. She has done social work with psychotic homeless women in San Francisco, continues working with Burning Man out in the Nevada desert and a few years ago she started her own business as a professional Intuitive Counselor.

Natalie used to be out of control with her healing of others, she was super sensitive to other peoples feelings and couldn't help taking it on. Thank goodness she found BPI in 1998, here she learned psychic meditation and started to get a hold of her abilities. Taking classes and programs gave her the wisdom to laugh at herself, especially when the growing got rough. Natalie continues to laugh the hardest when things get a get a little tricky and prescribes this technique to others. She swears by it, calling it her best beauty secret by far.

Rev. Lisa Rowe, Teacher

Rev. Lisa Rowe grew up predominantly in the village of San Lorenzo, CA. At the age of 10 she became obsessed with Astrology and at age 12 learned Transcendental Meditation. In her teens her clairvoyance kicked on and she began having very vivid past life dreams. Raised a Catholic, she started to question what or who God was. Her Mother would tell her, "God is Jesus". Which still left her confused. So she began her quest to find out what God was or where God was.

Through nature and her connection to it, she received many of her own answers. However she had no idea what being grounded was and never fully felt safe in her body. This led her to the Berkeley Psychic Institute in 1993 where she has been taking classes and teaching for the past 20 years, this included 5 years of teaching Sunday School.

Empowered with psychic tools, she continues to create miracles and enjoy life. In her spare time, she enjoys time with her pets, her family, nature hikes and also making oils, incenses and candles!


Rev. Stuart Turner, Teacher

Hi, my name is Stuart Turner.
I am from Tucson, AZ home to some of the most magnificent thunderstorms. I have an associates degree in electronics and a bachelors in engineering from Arizona State University. I enjoy hiking, mountain biking on my well worn mongoose, swimming, and watching wildlife.

My first psychic reading occurred before attending the movie Stalker, which was the feature show next to the Psychics place of residence in Santa Monica.

Living in Los Angeles I worked for the same company that manufactured the rockets that flew to the moon; however, a process engineering opening at a San Francisco manufacturer drew me to the Bay Area. I found Berkeley Psychic Institute within a year of living in the Bay and attended a "Psychic Fair" which transformed my life.

Subsequently I began taking classes and graduated from the clairvoyant program in 2001 and have since become a Licensed Minister and Teacher at the Berkeley Psychic Institute, which is the seminary of the Church of Divine Man.
