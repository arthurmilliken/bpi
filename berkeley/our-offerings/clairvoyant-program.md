Are you looking for a road map to guide you through life’s challenges?

What if you can wake up every day doing the things you enjoy doing, knowing that you’ll be successful in all your endeavors. As a spiritually centered human being, you consciously create your life, what you do, how you show up, who you align yourself with.

You can have a spiritually centered life. When you consciously choose and create everything in your life, you set yourself free from patterns and each success builds upon itself.

Use your clairvoyance to discern your choices and see your own truth.

Having this skill provides a model for creating healthy relationships, a fulfilling and meaningful career and a thriving spiritual practice where you trust yourself at all times. No matter what challenges life presents to you, you are able to work your way through them and ultimately achieve your goals.

What if life is a game, and it’s meant to be fun? What games do you play, where do you get stuck?

Do you know who you are and what you want in life? Or do you constantly find yourself a victim of life’s circumstances? If you are feeling lost, confused, unclear, or unmotivated, maybe you’re just playing the wrong game.

How are your spending your time? Is it with activities that inspire and nourish you or are withering on the vine? Why do you keep finding yourself in the same old, stale unhappy situations? Do you have the right tools to navigate life’s obstacles and challenges? Are you grabbing the simple solutions that are in front of you, or are you programmed to do it the hard way?

Who are the people you spend the most time with? Are they fun and supportive, do they have similar goals, can they validate and appreciate who truly you are, do they really get you? Or do you feel like a victim, being judged all the time, without anyone to support you? That’s a hard life to have.

Are you ready to change and play a new game? The Intensive Clairvoyant Program Is It!

The Intensive Clairvoyant Training Program is a one to two-year long in-house or online program offered exclusively to those who are committed to developing their psychic abilities and using their clairvoyance to live a spiritually centered life.

The program gives you all the help you need to create and implement a robust plan for long-term spiritual growth, awareness and understanding. It enables you to use your inner compass to guide you in your journey through life, so you can do the things you love doing, surrounding yourself with supportive relationships and have a purposeful life.

It’s fully tailored to your own needs. The Clairvoyant Program includes classes, readings, spiritual counseling, trainings and events to help you get new insights into your own spiritual heritage.

There are many spiritual teachings and traditions available to everyone, so what makes the Berkeley Psychic Institute (BPI) unique and different?

BPI is the oldest institution in the world that offers the highest quality and most thorough training in psychic development and awareness. For almost 40 years, BPI has taught over 300,000 people specific techniques that develop intuition. Using your intuitive abilities, you can increase your joy, enthusiasm and passion for life.

Here are some of our strongest beliefs that are reflected in the very foundations of the program.

Firstly, clarity trumps complexity.
BPI is a psychic kindergarten - a spiritual sanctuary to explore, develop, discover and play with your unique psychic abilities. The tools are taught in a simple manner in an environment free of competition and judgement. You will immediately use the tools in the class while the instuctions are fresh in your mind.

Secondly, your own answers are better than anyone else’s.
Here at the Berkeley Psychic Institute, we don’t tell you what our truth is, we teach you tools to find your own truth and enable you to grow spiritually. You will receive hands on training from high caliber gifted psychics who will provide a safe, fun, supportive environment, and validate you every step of the way.

Thirdly, any plan is only as good as your ability to implement it.
That is why the program is intensive and a year or two long. You will be extremely proficient with all the tools you have learned, have a thorough command of your psychic abilities, and have a level of self awareness previously unimagined.

Finally, most people in the world are not using their psychic skills consciously.
You will have the support of your fellow students, teachers and staff traveling on their parallel path who can validate the uniqueness of your psychic adventures. When you have a group of people who consciously use their intuitive abilities together, it creates a very powerful spiritual environment and agreements.

The main spiritual ability we teach is clairvoyance, one’s ability to be aware of energy within and around you and be neutral about it. From clairvoyance, you get to see your truth, have clarity and create effortlessly.

Be part of the Intensive Clairvoyant training program and discover your soul essence, who you truly are as a spirit. The creator of the universe is alive inside you waiting for you to claim your birth right, your spiritual heritage. Let your soul essence flow through everything you do and in the relationships you have.
