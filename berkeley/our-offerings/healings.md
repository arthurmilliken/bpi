What is a Male Healing?
Getting a male healing is like an oil change on your car or an upgrade on your computer. The car runs smoother and the computer keeps working. Just like the computer's upgrade, you get to be compatible with the world around you. Each week we are offering male healings, a chance for you to get your own spiritual upgrade. 10 minutes each. Call to book or just walk in!

What is a Trance Medium Healing? Healers channel experienced healing beings to give you a powerful healing unlike any other.  A trance medium healing can help you regain your emotional, mental and spiritual balance. It is a gentle, but intensive energy healing done by experienced channeling healers. A quick healing takes about 5 minutes and the healer may impart a sentence or two of description of the healing work. A lengthy recorded healing takes 15 minutes and the healer gives a more detailed reading of the healing work performed. Both healings are powerful and many people feel the transformative effects for days, weeks or months.

Special Offer for On-Going Trance Medium Healings: No need to call or register each week!
DHC Monthly Healing Packages include four Trance Medium healings each month:

3 "Quick" 5 min healings
1 "Lengthy" 15 min recorded healing + reading.
Contribution: $49 a month ($65 value) for four healings. Sign up for this unique easy to manage healing package: 707-542-6680 or [staff@divinehealingcenter.org](mailto:staff@divinehealingcenter.org)
