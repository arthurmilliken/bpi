What is an aura reading? The aura reading is a spiritual counseling and is truly one of the great spiritual experiences on the planet.  Who are you, the spirit?  What are you working towards and where have you come from?  What questions do you have about your life?  We read 3 past lives, your chakra abilities, 7 layers of your aura, and answer 3 of your questions. Through this process we look at and validate who you are as a spirit.
