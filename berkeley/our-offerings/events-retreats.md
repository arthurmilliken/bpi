Say hello to the God of your heart, feel free to bring food for the potluck, and heal yourself. Contact your local pastor if you're interested in doing a church part. Berkeley Psychic Institute is the Seminary of the Church of Divine Man. CDM is a non-denominational psychic Christian church that is open to everyone.

BPI and DHC created together a NEW version of the SILENT Church service with an added component: Special World Tones Chakra cleansing music and a special BPI Meditation/Sermon at the second half of the service. Please join us for this new and exciting combined DHC/BPI activity in our building!

Our Creed

We of the Church believe in limitless space, timeless endurance, never ending acceptance, everlasting patience, and continuous comprehension. "What if a man gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" asks Jesus. To a mystic with eyes turned inward to infinity and cosmic consciousness, his words have great meaning. Psychic freedom creates no ideologies, no isms, no dissenting philosophies which divide, corrupt and destroy communication between human souls. No governments are upturned, no faiths cut down by the sword, no sects or types eliminated; only a one to one contact between the cosmic and a living soul, which flames quietly, bringing a lifetime of contentment and a realization that nothing in this world is worth exchanging for that attainment.
