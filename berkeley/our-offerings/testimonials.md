Testimonials

"The magic I experienced in the Your Own Birth workshop was amazing – it was my first time getting in touch with my clairvoyance, and I felt empowered by learning how to ground, calling my energy back to myself, and using my third eye consciously. It was so much fun sitting next to clairvoyant students and feeling like I was in a safe environment to play with the tools given to me."

"What an amazing healing experience. Felt so much more peace during and after this session. I had lots of fun laughing and grounding out energies having to do with control issues in relationships with my mom, and healing through sharing others experiences.

"I enjoy periodically receiving regular professional psychic readings from Carmen Figueras. They also have great healings and women's retreats such as the Calistoga retreats and Lady of the Lake. Changed my life and helped me to become a grounded and centered person. Highly recommended."

Testimonial: The healing begins the moment I decide to head to BPI; and once there, I am relieved of my psychological and physical burdens, and validated at the same time. The information I am given is very helpful and insightful. I am so grateful they are here! -Helen Vandeman

Spot On Fascinating
This was my first time with a psychic reading. Both readers, Jason and Keith, were so amazingly in tune with my vibrations and the things that are going on in my inner and outer life. My questions were all answered, so simply. I'm going through some major life changes and they spotted everything and offered guidance and healing, never judging. Thank you, BPI and my readers! - J.B.

Amazing...!!!
"I have visited the BPI in the early 90's, then in 2003 and this past weekend. The staff is very professional and extremely helpful. My readers blew me away. I had my 16 year old daughter participate and she was equally amazed and in awe. This was a very positive experience, my 'onion layers' have never been peeled with such accuracy. A sense of calm has returned--thank you! "

Great birthday present!
"The students and staff were friendly and welcoming. I was a bit skeptical at first because I was getting a student reading and wasn't sure how accurate it would be. However, their insights were extremely relevant to my current life issues and made a lot of sense. It was totally worth it to have four students put their attention on me for 2 hours! And much cheaper than therapy. Very fun. I gave this aura reading to 3 of my friends and to my father for birthday presents! They all loved it. "

Reading with Graduates and Female Reading
"I was floored by the profound insight that I was given without uttering more then a few words. My experience was so moving that I will recommend this reading with graduates to my family. I found them to be honest, open and caring. I know I was given exactly what i was meant to hear. I will definetly continue with healings and workshops to help cleanse and attune my skills. There truly is no greater gift then being in touch with your true self and having other people truly see who you really are."

Awesome reading and Healing!
"As a former graduate of 1994, it was great to be back at BPI. I know that these readers and healers cleaned out so much stuff. It was awesome and I could see that we all benefited from it so much. They are truly amazing and I will get back into using my spiritual tools and taking a few refresher courses, too. "

I was amazed
"Every time I get a reading, how accurate and right on the psychic is about seeing what is going on in my life. I usually come in every few years when I am trying to figure out something. The student readings are amazing and they help me to see what is really going on in situations with myself and other people. I love all of you and the work you do is so spiritual, deep, helpful, and life-changing."

TM Healing
My TM Healing was far more than I expected! Life is anew with my son. Light was shed on a situation that I didn't even know was going on!! Information was provided too that really caused me to change for the better!! The changes have been significant and I have completely turned around my relationship with my son. I am SO relieved and feel absolutely lucky for the healing that was provided. I am incredibly grateful!! Sincerely, Julianne O

Got my answer in 5 minutes
"Received a brief TM healing. Heart palpitations stopped immediately. The spiritual hello stabilized my emotions , and I knew exactly what my next steps were. Hands on Healing was also a WOW experience."

Changed My Life
"For a long time when life was difficult I went to see a therapist. From there, I moved to lawyers. Now, when life gets overwhelming, I get a healing at BPI. For me it is the best option--I get to see clearly what is going on, how things from my past are affecting me in the present and I get to let go of old information and beliefs (that may not even really be MY information and beliefs!) that do not work for me anymore."

TM Healing
"WOW!!! Blown away... I can't even put into words. My soul came excited like I was there to meet old friends and I left excited and full and I felt so vibrant. I am thankful and intrigued by it all. I felt sensitive all my life but seeing someone understand everything going on was amazing. Just amazing how aware they were. Wow my soul needed this. I needed this in my life thank you!!!!"

CDM Highly Recommended
"I was a bit nervous prior to the healing. All the readers made me feel at ease and were right on target with their sensory capabilities. After the healing, I felt a calmness come over me and relived that my inner most intuition were validated. Going forward, I plan on following their recommendations. I look forward to attending their meditation class and having a family reading class."

Driver's Seat
"BPI’s meditation and healing classes gave me control over my life. I no longer feel like life just “happens to me” – I’m in the driver’s seat and I can take charge, while experiencing my higher intuition at the same time."

Beginning Classes Student


Beginning Meditation Class
"Ever since taking the Beginning Meditation class, I’m grounded, confident, less absent minded, and happy! Learning how to heal my spiritual and physical self was incredible too. I used to go through cycles of pain and joy, not feeling in control of either one. Now I enjoy every step along my path with a greater awareness. There’s always something new to experience at BPI, and it’s a great sanctuary to practice what you’ve learned."

"What a great place! Welcoming, inviting and friendly. I used a coupon for the Career Path reading and it was such a fantastic experience! I can't wait to go back. Thanks!"

Freedom
"It's taken me a few years to *really* realize that the most important thing I got from going through BPI's clairvoyant program is freedom. True freedom. I get to choose how and whether to respond to things, and I have awareness now when I'm reacting versus consciously responding. The laughter and the freedom are real gifts."

Diane Wren (South Portland, Maine)


Communicating to the 'Real Me'
"When I stepped into BPI’s institute in Berkeley, I had a feeling this place would change my life. For the first time ever, people were communicating to the real ‘me’ as a spirit, not just my physical body. I can’t begin to express the joy it brings to experience that."

Veronika (Oakland, CA)
