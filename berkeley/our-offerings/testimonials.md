Testimonials

"The magic I experienced in the Your Own Birth workshop was amazing â€“ it was my first time getting in touch with my clairvoyance, and I felt empowered by learning how to ground, calling my energy back to myself, and using my third eye consciously. It was so much fun sitting next to clairvoyant students and feeling like I was in a safe environment to play with the tools given to me."

"What an amazing healing experience. Felt so much more peace during and after this session. I had lots of fun laughing and grounding out energies having to do with control issues in relationships with my mom, and healing through sharing others experiences.

"I enjoy periodically receiving regular professional psychic readings from Carmen Figueras. They also have great healings and women's retreats such as the Calistoga retreats and Lady of the Lake. Changed my life and helped me to become a grounded and centered person. Highly recommended."

Testimonial: The healing begins the moment I decide to head to BPI; and once there, I am relieved of my psychological and physical burdens, and validated at the same time. The information I am given is very helpful and insightful. I am so grateful they are here! -Helen Vandeman
